#Conway's Game of Life
# The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells,
# each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead, or "populated" or "unpopulated".
# Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically,
# or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
#
# Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
#
# Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
# 
# Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
# 
# Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
#
# The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying
# the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seedâ€”births and deaths occur simultaneously, and
# the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick (in other words, each generation
# is a pure function of the preceding one). The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further
# generations.
